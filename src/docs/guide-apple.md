# Apple

The following is a guide for building apps on Apple's `MacOS` and `iOS`
operating systems.

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for a (free) [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/) account.
2. Register your [devices][apple-dev-devices-add] for testing. You can use `ssc list-devices`
command to get your Device ID (UDID). Device should be connected to your mac by wire.
3. Create a wildcard [App ID][apple-dev-appid] for the application you are developing.
4. Write down your `Team ID`. It's in the top right corner of the website. You'll need this later.

### MacOS
- Xcode Command Line Tools. If you don't have them already, and you don't have xcode,
you can run the command `xcode-select --install`.

### iOS

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/) (You won't need to even open it)
- [Apple Configurator][apple-configurator] (If you want to build iOS apps)

## Code Signing Certificates

- Open Keychain Access application on your mac (it's in Applications/Utilities).
- In the Keychain Access application choose Keychain Access -> Certificate Assistant -> Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority...

- Type you email in the User Email Address field. Other form elements are optional.

- Choose Request is Saved to Disc and save your certificate request.

### MacOS

Signing software on `MacOS` is optional but it's the best practice. Not signing
software is like using `http` instead of `https`.

- [Create][apple-dev-certificates-add] a new `Developer ID Application` certificate
on the Apple Developers website.
- Choose a certificate request you've created 2 steps earlier.
- Download your certificate and double click to add it to your Keychain.

### iOS

To run software on iOS, it **must** be signed by Xcode using the certificate data
contained in a "Provisioning Profile". This is a file generated by Apple and it
links `app identity`, `certificates` (used for code signing), `app permissions`,
and phystical `devices`.

- [Create][apple-dev-certificates-add] a new iOS Distribution (App Store and Ad Hoc) certificate on the Apple Developers website.
- Choose a certificate request you've created 2 steps earlier.
- Download your certificate and double click to add it to your Keychain.

When you run `ssc compile --target=ios .` on your project for the first time, you may see the
following because you don't have a provisioning profile:

```
ssc compile --target=ios .
• provisioning profile not found: /Users/chicoxyzzy/dev/socketsupply/birp/./distribution.mobileprovision. Please specify a valid provisioning profile in the ios_provisioning_profile field in your `ssc.config`
```

- [Create][apple-dev-profiles-add] a new Ad Hoc profile. Use the App ID you created with the wildcard.
- Pick the certificate that you added to your Keychain two steps earlier.
- Add the devices that the profile will use.
- Add a name for your new distribution profile (we recommend to name it "distribution").
- Download the profile and double click it. This action will open Xcode. You can close it after it's completely loaded.
- Place your profile to your project directory (same directory as `ssc.config`). **The profiles are secret, add your profile to `.gitignore`**.

## Configuration

### MacOS

You will want to ensure the following fields are filled out in your `ssc.config`
file. They will look something like this...

```yaml
mac_team_id: Z3M838H537
mac_sign: Developer ID Application: Operator Tools Inc. (Z3M838H537)
```

### iOS

1. Set the `ios_distribution_method` value in `ssc.config` to the `ad-hoc`
1. Set the `ios_codesign_identity` value in `ssc.config` to the [certificate](#certificate) name as it's displayed in the Keychan or copy it from the output of `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`
1. Set the `ios_provisioning_profile` value in `ssc.config` to the filename of your certificate (i.e., "distribution.mobileprovision").

## Development
Create a simulator VM and launch the app in it

```bash
ssc compile --target=iossimulator -r .
```

## Distribution And Deployment

```bash
ssc compile --target=ios -c -p -xd .
```

### To your device

Install [Apple Configurator][apple-configurator], open it and install Automation Tools from the menu.

![](../images/screenshots/prov-prof-3.png)


Connect your device and run `ssc install-app <path>` where path is the root directory of your application (the one where `ssc.config` is located).

Alternative way to install your app is to open the the `Apple Configurator` app and drag
the inner `/dist/build/[your app name].ipa/[your app name].ipa` file onto your phone.

### To the Apple App Store

```bash
xcrun altool --validate-app \
  -f file \
  -t platform \
  -u username [-p password] \
  [--output-format xml]
```

```bash
xcrun altool --upload-app \
  -f file \
  -t platform \
  -u username [-p password] \
  [—output-format xml]
```

## Debugging

Check the [troubleshooting guide][/troubleshooting] first. You can also run
[`lldb`][lldb] and attach to a process, for example...

```bash
process attach --name TestExample-dev
```

## Logging

To see logs on either platform, open `Console.app` (installed on MacOS by default)
and in the right side panel pick the device or computer name.

## Working with the file system on iOS

iOS Application Sandboxing has a set of rules that limits access to the file system.
Apps can only access files in their own sandboxed home directory.

| Directory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Documents` | The app’s sandboxed documents directory. The contents of this directory is backed up by iTunes and may be set as accessable to the user via iTunes when `UIFileSharingEnabled` is set to `true` in application's `info.plist`. |
| `Library` | The app’s sandboxed library directory. The contents of this directory are synchronised via iTunes (except the `Library/Caches` subdirectory, see below), but never exposed to the user. |
| `Library/Caches` | The app’s sandboxed caches directory. The contents of this directory are not synchronised via iTunes, and may be deleted by the system at any time. It's a good place to store data which provides a good offline-first experience for the user. |
| `Library/Preferences` | The app’s sandboxed preferences directory. The contents of this directory are synchronised via iTunes. It's purpose is to be used by the Settings app. Avoid creating your own files in this directory. |
| `tmp` | The app’s sandboxed temporary directory. The contents of this directory are not synchronised via iTunes, and may be deleted by the system at any time. Although, it's recommended that you delete data which is not necessary anymore manually to minimize the space your app takes up on the file system. Use this directory to store data which is only useful during the app runtime. |
